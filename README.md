# Eestec-Challenge-2019

EESTech Challenge is a competition organized by EESTEC, third year in a row.
It aims to create opportunities for European students to gain knowledge in the field of EECS and develop their professional network.
The technological topic of the competition is changed annually, and this year it is Internet of Things.

My team JBM won the local round in Athens and so we had the chance to participate to the final round
in Munich.
